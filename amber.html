<h1>Dumb Drunk Shoots Man in His Own Home</h1>
<h4>By: JoeSauce</h4>
*THIS IS SATIRE*
	<p>Aight so basically this hilarious excuse for a cop said "aye ya know what? I havent done my daily does of killing today, ya dig?" so she got super lit after work and went to the wrong apartment. "Woah, a perfect opportunity," she thought to herself "an unlocked door! I'm boutta explore that." She walked in and saw a black dude eating ice cream. She then had another thought to herself. "Dang bro this day just keeps getting better! So many opportunities!" She then pulled out her gun and shot the homie and claimed to be too drunk  to notice that she was in the wrong apartment.</p>
